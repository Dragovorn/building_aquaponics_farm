[h1]Overview[/h1]

Adds an upgrade for Hydroponics Farm called the Aquaponics Farm, which converts one farmer job into an Angler job.  The technology to construct this building is available to all non-gestalt empires.  Aquaponics is a combination of aquaculture (raising aquatic animals for food) where the nutrient-rich waste water is used to feed hydroponically-grown crops that filter it, and then re-used.  The new Angler job already represents aquaculture, so it felt appropriate to upgrade the Hydroponics Farm building to provide one of each job instead of farming only.

[h1]Changes[/h1]
Adds the new technology Aquaponics which creates an upgrade for the Hydroponics Farms called an Aquaponics Farm.  The Aquaponics Farm respects existing features of the Hydroponics Farm: Void Dwellers gain an extra farmer job, Angler empires gain an extra Angler job on wet worlds, and farmer jobs convert to Acolytes of the Plow for Spiritualist fallen/awakened empires.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
Requires the Aquatics DLC.

Overwrites the built-in Hydroponics Farm building ([b]building_hydroponics_farm[/b]) in order for it to be upgradeable to an Aquaponics Farm.  Also overwrites the built-in Angler job ([/b]angler[/b]) so that any empire can work Angler jobs.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
Overriding a building or job causes the game to log errors noting the overrides.  Expect to see two lines in the error.log file like these:
